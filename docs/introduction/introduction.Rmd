# Our mission

* Introduce R as a programming language and `<<data science>>` environment

* Introduce R Studio as an IDE

* Get you working on your use cases quickly

---
# A little bit about R


* R started with S... 1976-05-05 at Bell Labs


.bottom[
![Bell](Bell_Laboratories_logo.svg)

]

--

* Developed out of the statistics department

--

* Non-standard methods were needed

--

* Solution: Develop programming language and environment designed explicitly for **interactive** data analysis using the best available computation methods and flexible enough to meet new use cases!

# If you can do something well, then have someone pay you for it

.right-column[
S was then sold to the open market as S

Later distributed as S-Plus

Bought by TIBCO

]

.left-column[

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("libs/S-PLUS.gif")
```
]

---
# After S, R?

* Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman met at University of Auckland while Dr. Gentleman on sabbatical

.center[
![auk](https://www.library.auckland.ac.nz/resources/images/UOA-NT-HC-RGB.png?r=2)
]

--

* Common Problem: `$A$`, `$-plus`, `$TATA`, `$P$$`

--

* Solution: Develop an __open source__ implementation of S!

--

* Allow for new methods to be adopted and shared through **packages** <sup>*</sup>

.footnote[[*] Packages are ways of collecting, documenting and sharing R (or other language) scripts that have been pre-written. They can be installed and then run as new functions extending base-R]

---

# CRAN Established

* Comprehensive R Archive Network Established [cran](https://cran.r-project.org)  

--

* Hosting of the software itself and packages

--

* R-Core established to review and approve packages for inclusion on CRAN  

---
# Why chose R?

* It's Free!!!  

--

* It's flexible  

--

* Access to the newest methods  

--

* The community support is strong  

--

* It has been extended into webpage generation, documentation, dashboards, etc  

---

# Why not R?

--

* Syntax is *not* consistent between packages  


```{r eval=FALSE}
# From randomForest
rf_1 <- randomForest(x, y, mtry = 12, ntree = 2000, importance = TRUE)

# From ranger
rf_2 <- ranger(
  y ~ ., 
  data = dat, 
  mtry = 12, 
  num.trees = 2000, 
  importance = 'impurity'
)

```

--

* Packages have not necessarily been vetted and completely de-bugged  

--

* R **can** be slower than some other languages  
--

* Performs calculations _in-memory_ (e.g. data < RAM)

# R Studio

.center[![Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/RStudio-Logo-Blue-Gray-600x211.png)]

* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/), a for profit company, developed an IDE for R  

--

* IDE is an Integrated Development Environment  

--
* Syntax highlighting, auto-complete, visual exploration, integration with version control systems  and more!

Put the project in a new directory (typically the default)
---
class: center, top
# Create a new project

We would like a new project (other items are for more advanced topics)

Name the new project and place it in whatever directory works for you

# Scripting Pane



![new](libs/rstudio_default_layout_2_script.png)

---

# Scripting Pane (Where the magic happens)

Generally you want to write all of your code here in either:

- Rmarkdown document (.Rmd)  

- R script (.R)

This way you can save your code and submit it to R!

--

(And save a copy to run again later)

--

You can send the script to R using the `CRTL + ENTER`/ `CMD + ENTER` Shortcut

---


class: center, top
# Environment Pane

This is where you will find objects that are `in-memory` or available to call

# File Directory Pane

---

# Console

The console is the heart of R and the best calculator in the world

```{r}
4+6
```

If you type directly the output will be printed, but *not* saved

--

To save you need to use the assignment operator `<-` to store the object in memory

```{r}
my_output <- 4+6
my_output
```

# Additional Tabs

![new](libs/rstudio_additional_tabs.png)

Additional tabs contain other objects include files, plots, packages, and viewer

# Help!

![new](libs/rstudio_help.png)

A handy feature is the searchable help pane where you can get information on functions

---

# Additional Help

You can also use the console to help you *find help*

To call the help file for a particular function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
??lm
```

--

For a function that you can't quite remember...

```{r}
apropos("glm")
```

# Package Viewer

![new](libs/rstudio_packages_viewer.png)

The package viewer allows you to see your install packages (with links to the function descriptions)

# Package Install


![new](libs/rstudio_package_install.png)

You can install packages from `cran` using the package install feature

Later we will install packages from other sources like github

# Parts of an Rmarkdown Document - YAML Header

The YAML header block is separated by three `_` symbols  

```
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Michael DeWitt"
date: "9/5/2018"
output: html_document
---

```
--

Specifies to `pandoc` how to convert the document and into what format to render the document

- html_output = html  

- pdf_output = pdf  

- word_output = Microsoft Word   
    
---

# Parts of an Rmarkdown Document - Code Chunks


Code chunks can be inserted with `CTRL + ALT + I` or `CMD + ALT + I`


```{r eval=FALSE}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ disp + wt, data = mtcars)
```


--

Here you can type R code, and determine if the output will be printed in the document

--

You can run each code chunk by pressing the green arrow in the chunk 

--

Or running the code line by line

---
# Parts of an Rmarkdown Document - Plain Text

The rest of the Rmarkdown is plain text

--

This is where you can write down ideas, your opinions, your findings

--

You can use this for both exploration (think lab notebook) and final documents

--

Rmarkdown also provides ways to add some additional formatting

---

# Rmarkdown Markup

## Formatting

.pull-left[

`#` # Header 1

`##` ## Header 2 


`*italics*` or `_italics_` for *italics*


`**bold**` or `__bold__` for **bold**

]

.pull-right[

`-` or `*` for bullets

* Bullet 1  
* Bullet 2  
    * Bullet 2a  


`1` for numbered lists

1 Item 1  
2 Item 2  


`$\int_{a}^bx^2dx$` for $\LaTeX$ e.g. $\int_{a}^bx^2dx$

]

# Some final words about the course
  
--

The emphasis is on _application_ and not on _theory_

--

I will teach using the `tidyverse` paradigm

--

We will learn data structures as we go along (not a programming class)

--

My way isn't always the best way (always alternatives)
