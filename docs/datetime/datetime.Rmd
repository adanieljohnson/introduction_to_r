# But Dates and Times are Challenging

# Dates and Times are Special

- Months have different days (even particular months change their days!)

- Time has inconsistent units (hours, seconds)

- Time zones!

- They are ordered (so we can't treat them as characters)

---

# And...we all don't use the same conventions!

--
1. YYYY-MM-DD

--

1. MM-DD-YYYY

--

1. MM/DD/YYYY

--

1. YYYYMMDD

--

1. DDMMYYYY

--

1. MMMYY

--

1. Somethings else?????

## R Solution?

- Add a new `type` to deal with dates and times

--

This new type will allow the R internals to handle date/ time conversions and calculations

--

You just need to know how to convert an object to a date to take advantage...

---
# R Doesn't Recognize Dates Immediately Sometimes

```{r}
class("2017-10-17")
```

```{r}
class("10/17/2018")
```

---
# Explicitly Defining Dates

R has some built in function to help define dates

Personally I find them difficult and [unintuitive](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/strptime.html) to use...

```{r}
z_base <- strptime("20/2/06 11:16:16", "%d/%m/%y %H:%M")
z_base
```

---

# Enter `lubridate`

`lubridate` is another `tidyverse` package designed to detail with dates

--

It has functions that make dealing with dates more intuitive

```{r}
library(lubridate)

z_lub <- dmy_hms("20/2/06 11:16:16", tz = "America/New_York")
z_lub
```

See the [cheatsheet](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/lubridate.pdf)

---

# `lubridate` provides several functions for dates

The function you use depends on the format in which you find your data

`ymd` for **Year** ("/"|"-") **Month** ("/"|"-") **Day**

`dmy` for **Day** ("/"|"-") **Month** ("/"|"-") **Year**

`mdy` for **Month** ("/"|"-") **Day** ("/"|"-") **Year**

---

# Additionally We Can Specify The Timezone

```{r}
mdy("10/16/2018", tz = "Pacific/Auckland")
```

---
# Sometimes we are interested in a part of a date

 `day` returns the day number
 
 `week` returns the week number
 
 `wday` returns the day of the week
 
 `month` returns the month number
 
 `year` returns the year
---

# Times

Times are also tricky for many of the same reasons

But `lubridate` has our solution

_And_ `lubridate` functions are compatible with `tidyverse` workflows

---

# Datetimes vs times

R via `lubridate` has two representations of times

`Datetimes` which have a date _and_ time component

`Times` which have a time component only

The context will guide you as to how to manipulate the data

---

# Our Functions

## Date Times
For each `ymd` combination we have an associated function to parse:
- hours only `ymd_h`
- hours and minutes `ymd_hm`
- hours, minutes, seconds `ymd_hms`
- etc

--

## Times

Same as above without the date function

---

# Calculating Differences

To calculate differences between dates and time it is best to establish an "interval"

```{r}
interval(ymd("20161016"), dmy("1/1/2017"))
```

--
We can then do calculations on it for example days in this interval using `d*` functions

```{r}
interval(ymd("20161016"), dmy("1/1/2017"))/ddays(1)
```

--

Or even seconds

```{r}
interval(ymd("20161016"), dmy("1/1/2017"))/dseconds(1)
```

---

# Datetimes Allow Times Series Analysis

USing the [`forecast`](https://otexts.org/fpp2/) package we can implement advanced time series models (ARIMA, etc)

Using [`CausalImpact`](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/CausalImpact.html) we can estimate Causality using Bayesian Structural Times Series

Using [`prophet`](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html) we can forecast at scale using Bayesian estimation

And, And...

# Recap

Date and Times are tricky. Period.

R has excellent faculties for dealing with dates and times

`lubridate` can help us convert our dates and times to R dates and times

---

# We have some functions from `lubridate` to help us

#### Convert

`ymd` for **Year** ("/"|"-") **Month** ("/"|"-") **Day**

`dmy` for **Day** ("/"|"-") **Month** ("/"|"-") **Year**

`mdy` for **Month** ("/"|"-") **Day** ("/"|"-") **Year**

#### Manipulate
 `day` / `week` / `wday` / `month` /`year`/`hour`/`second` to parse the desired component
 
 `interval` to create and interval between two dates
 
 `d*` functions to calculate the difference (in units desired)
 
 And others depending on your need! See [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)
