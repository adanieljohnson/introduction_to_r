# Good Programming Practices

One day you will hand off your project

--

You take a new position

--

Get promoted

--

The future you who hasn't looked at the project in months (years?)

--

Good project organisation looks good to an employer

--

**You don't want to be on call forever!**

# Applying good practices will save you time

* You don't have to re-invent the wheel each time to reopen your work

* Providing project structure removes some of the "writer's block"

# The RStudio Project Structure

We are going to utilise the RStudio Project Structure

--

.pull-left[
This will provide an *anchor* for our project structure
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100px"}
include_graphics("libs/anchor.png")
```

]
--

.pull-left[

Start a new *directory*

]
--


.pull-left[
The project will be completely self contained in this directory
]
--
.pull-left[

Allows anyone to take our project folder and run our *exact* same analysis
]
---

# .Rproj

.RProj is the heart of the R Studio Project

--

Basically a small text configuration file that specifies

* Project working directory (aka where in the filesystem the project exists) 

* Allows relative file paths to be used reliably

* General configurations

--

We must turn off saving RData file!!!

---

# Building the scaffolding

Start each project with a basic directory structure within your project

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(data.tree)
acme <- Node$new("data analysis project")
  data <- acme$AddChild("data")
  figs <- acme$AddChild("figs")
  munge <- acme$AddChild("munge")
  src <- acme$AddChild("src")
  output <- acme$AddChild("output")
  reports <- acme$AddChild("reports")
  
  print(acme)

```

--

These represent the _juste necessaire_ for each project

---

# Enhanced Directory Structure (recommended)

The enhanced structure adds a few more folders which can be helpful for more advanced projects

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(data.tree)
acme <- Node$new("data analysis project")
  data <- acme$AddChild("data")
  munge <- acme$AddChild("munge")
  output <- acme$AddChild("output")
  src <- acme$AddChild("src")
  figs <- acme$AddChild("figs")
  reports <- acme$AddChild("reports")
  req <- acme$AddChild("req***")
  tests <- acme$AddChild("test***")
  
  print(acme)

```

--

Adding `req` and `test` will become clear as we explore this expanded structure

---

# Starting with a README

```{r echo=FALSE}
acme <- Node$new("data analysis project")
  data <- acme$AddChild("data")
  munge <- acme$AddChild("munge")
  output <- acme$AddChild("output")
  src <- acme$AddChild("src")
  figs <- acme$AddChild("figs")
  reports <- acme$AddChild("reports")
  req <- acme$AddChild("req")
  tests <- acme$AddChild("test")
readme_base <- acme$AddChild("README.md/ README.Rmd")
print(acme)
```

Your project directory should start with a README file that indicates a few basic components of your project

--

* **Project Title**

* **Project Team and Contact Information**

* **Purpose**: What is the goal of the project/ research question

---
# The README

Serves as a top level introduction to the project

--

And at the end, you can put your abstract here!

.center[
```{r out.width="900px", echo=FALSE}
include_graphics("libs/maria_abstract.png")
```

]

---

# usethis::use_rmd_readme

RStudio has made initiating a README file easy

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
```

--

Use the markdown mark-up language to format the new document

---

# It All Starts With The Data

## Rules of Data

### Rule #1 You never alter the raw data

--

### Rule #2 You never, ever alter the raw data

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTj5FDF_huM2B6kPVktNN0ZX883LlRuhzg0hA4v1W0D0q166aaI")
```

]

---

# data


This is a folder to store whatever raw files you have

Reproducibility starts with data provenance

--

### Add a README

Use a README file _within_ the data directory to list the facts about your data

* Date of collection  

* Who collected it  

* Method of acquisition  

* Codebook/ Fieldname Descriptions

---

# Munge - Now It's Time to Play

_munge_ - mash until no good

This is the folder to store scripts that take the _raw data_ and _clean it_

--

Then write out the _cleaned data_ into the `output` folder for future use

--

As painful as it is, all cleaning should be done programatically

```{r eval=FALSE}
clean_df_1 <- df_raw %>%
  mutate(student_id = str_extract_all(id, pattern = "0\\d{7}"))
```


--

e.g. Your munge code will _always_ work if new data overwrote your old data

---

# Outputs

As mentioned, this is the home for any kind of outputed data

* Cleaned data with a descriptive name

* Useful to version using a date (YYYY-MM-DD)

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_csv(cleaned_data, paste0("output/", Sys.Date(), "_data_cleaned.csv"))
```


---

# src let's start writing

`src` is the folder to write all of your scripts

--

### Start Your Analysis By Running Previous Steps

Typically these scripts will start by running any cleaning scripts with something like

```{r eval=FALSE}

lapply(list.files(path = "munge",full.names = T, pattern = ".R"), source)

```

--

This command will look for all `.R` files in the `munge` folder and run them

*All about reproducibility*

---

# Analysis is fun!

Save each analysis as a separate R script

Save a script based on the topic it covers or the question your were exploring

.pull-left[
### Good

linear_regression.R

]

.pull-right[
### BAD

test.R

final.R

untitled.R

]

---

# Parts of a Script

Each script should have the same basic form

--

### Purpose
The purpose describes what the script is attempting to accomplish/ or question being asked

Comments use the `#` symbol for comments (not read by R)

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Purpose: The purpose of this script is to look at a linear relationship between mpg and disp

fit_linear <- lm(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars)
```

--

### Libraries

It is useful to outline what libraries are used _at the top_ of the script.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(brms)
```

---

# Parts of a Script

Each script should have the same basic form

### Section Labels

If you can organise your code into logical sections, then add a section break by pressing 
.center[
`CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + R`
]
`# Calculating Summaries -------------------------------------------------`

---
# Parts of a Script

### Inline Comments

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Generate histogram

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt))+
  geom_histogram()

```

Imagine you are writing for your _future self_

Annotate code based on what you are _trying_ to do

---
# General Naming Conventions

Datasets should be named as nouns

--

Descriptive names are better than non-descriptive names

---

# Object Naming Examples

.pull-left[

## Good

- student_records  

- iris_data

- clean_data_final

]

.pull-right[

## Bad  

- data  

- my_data

- a

]

---
# Naming Functions

There will come a time when you will need to write your own function

It is advisable to name functions descriptively with **verbs**

```{r}
make_sum <- function( x, y) {
  out <- x + y
  
  return(out)
}
```

If they start with the same keyword, that can help, too!

---

# Whitespace

Whitespace is your friend

When writing, put spaces after `"("` , `","` to make the code legible

Indent with **two spaces**  when writing a long piece of code or in a block

---

# Whitespace and Punctuation (examples)

.pull-left[

## Good
```{r eval=FALSE}
if(this ==TRUE) {
  median(a, n)
} else{
  mean(a, b, trim = 0.2)
}
```

]

.pull-right[

## Bad
```{r eval=FALSE}
if(this ==TRUE) {median(a,n)} else{
  mean(a,b,trim=0.2)
}
```

]

Note that RStudio will correct to this convention if you highlight your code and press 

.center[
`CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + A`
]

---

# Naming Things

R is **case sensitive**

```{r error=TRUE}
a <- 1
A
```


--

The only rule for names is that an object cannot start with a number

--

Several conventions exist for naming objects

- snake_case (my prefered)

- camelCase

- dot.case

--

Whatever convention you use, stick with it!

---

# Outputing

Generally, you will use your `src` scripts to generate

- figures  

- summary tables

--

Write these out to the `output`

--

Treat the output folder as something that _should_ be over-written

---

# Reports

Write and maintain your final report in this folder

This should include your `.Rmd` file

Using the project structure you can reference your `figs` and `outputs`

---

# Tests

For more advanced users, it can be beneficial to include a `tests` folder

Here unit tests both on your code and your data can be performed

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(validate)
validate::check_that(mtcars, mpg >0, disp >0, vs <= 1, wt >0)
```

---

# Visualising Test Ouputs
.center[
```{r out.width="800px", }
barplot(validate::check_that(mtcars, mpg >0, disp >0, vs < .5, wt >0))
```
]

---

# Testing your modeling assumptions

You can use the `testthat` and `validate` functions to test your data and code

```{r include=FALSE}
library(testthat)
```


```{r}
# Function to check the normality of data using Shapiro-Wilk Test
check_normality <- function(df, alpha = 0.05) {
  p.value <- broom::tidy(shapiro.test(df))$p.value
  if (p.value <= alpha) {
    warning("Imported data is not normal, check QQ Plot")
  }
  else{
    cat("Data passed")
  }
}
```

```{r error=TRUE,}
non_normal_data <- rpois(10, 1) # Non-normal data should FAIL
normal_data <- rnorm(100, 54, 1.5) #Normal Data Should PASS

test_that("Function return correct conclusion", {
  expect_that(check_normality(non_normal_data), prints_text("Data passed"))
  expect_output(check_normality(normal_data))
})
```

---

# `req` and your own functions

Eventually you will need to write custom functions

Put these in the `req` folder and you can source them at the beginning of your analysis

Additionally, you can use this folder to list all of the libraries you need

---

# What it looks like

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Purpose: Install all required libraries for this project

if(!require("tidyverse", character.only = T)) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
  library(tidyverse)
} else{
  library(tidyverse)
}

if(!require("AER", character.only = T)) {
  install.packages("AER")
  library(AER)
} else{
  library(AER)
}

```

# Git Philosophy

In Git you work on a `branch` of a git repository or _repo_ (think version number)

--

Within your branch you can make changes and the `stage` and `commit` them (make edits) with comments

--

You can then `push` these changes (stores in memory)

--

If you like the changes you can merge them with the `master` branch

--

You and your collaborators can then `pull` the new master branch

--

If two people try to make changes on the same bit of code you will get a `merge` conflict.

# Diff

Version Control = Traceability of Changes

# Recap

### Adopt a File System
- Use a standard folder system
- Never alter the raw data

### Think Programatically
- Comments and Section Breaks
- README Files
- Design for reproducibility

### Version Control
- Use it
