# The boring bits

While the class is meant to be applied, there are some bits about the R language that are important to know when starting your programing journey.

# Data Types

Within R there are a limited number of data types

```{r echo=FALSE}
data_types <- tribble(
  ~`Data Type`, ~`Storage`, ~`Flexibility`,
  "Integer", "Integer Values Only", "Low",
  "Logical", "Logical Values (TRUE or FALSE)", "Low",
  "Factors", "Factor Numbers", "Low",
  "Numeric", "Any real number", "Medium",
  "Character", "All treated as character", "High"
)

data_types %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 30)

```

---
# Data Types

You can inspect the data types using the `class` function:

--

Integer
```{r}
class(1L)
```
--

Numeric
```{r}
class(1)
```

---
# Data Types

You can inspect the data types using the `class` function:

--

Logical
```{r}
class(TRUE)
```
--

Character
```{r}
class("Are we having fun yet?")
```

# How Data Are Stored via Object Types

Within R you deal with:

```{r echo=FALSE}
r_objects <- tribble(
  ~Object, ~Dimensionality, ~`Can Store`,
  "Atomic Vector", "1", "Only one type",
  "Matrix", "2", "Only one type
  same length",
  "Array", "n", "Only one type, same length",
  "Data frame", "2", "One type per column, can be diff. classes, same length",
  "List", "1", "Heterogeneous types, can be diff. lengths"
)
r_objects %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 30)


```


---
# Vectors -> The most simple case

Atomic vectors store only one "type" of data

--

Atomic vectors can be created using the `c` concatenate function and the assignment operator `<-`

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 79, 22)
```

--

Vectors can only be one type

```{r}
class(my_vector)
```

---

# Matrices -> 2 Dimensions of the Same

Matrices can store two dimensions, but the *type* and *length* must be the same
--
```{r}
(my_matrix <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE))
```
--
```{r}
(my_matrix <- matrix(c("A","B","C","D"), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE))
```
--
```{r}
(my_matrix <- matrix(c("A",1,"C","D"), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE))
```

---

# Arrays (n dimensions and beyond)

These are useful in simulations, but don't come up often

```{r}
(my_3d_array <- array( 1:9, dim = c(3,3,3)))
```

---

# Data Frames -> The workhorse of R

The power of a data frame is that each column can take on a different class but must be the same length

```{r}
(my_df <- data_frame(strings = c("A", "B", "C"), numbers = 1:3, 
                     logicals = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)))
```

--

We can then examine the structure of each column with the `str` function

```{r}
str(my_df)
```

---

# The list -> The utility hitter

The list is the most versitile of all objects and can store anything (one-dimensionally)

```{r}
my_list <- list(my_df = my_df, my_vector = my_vector, my_3d_array = my_3d_array, my_matrix = my_matrix)
```

--

Let's see what's inside...

```{r}
str(my_list)
```
