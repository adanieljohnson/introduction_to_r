- Factors throw weird errors

- They get in the way of sorting (sometimes)


---


# But Why Factors?

Categorical data types take on discrete values

--

Examples:

- Months of the Year

- Hair Color

- Likert Scales

- Political Party Affiliation

- etc

--

_Factors_ help R represent _categorical_ variables

# Factor Representation in R

Factors have a class of `factor`

```{r}
race <- factor(x = c("White", "Non-White"))
class(race)
```

--

Factors have "levels" which represent the values that the factor can take on

```{r}
levels(race)
```

---
# Coercion

You can can make any vector/ column a factor using `factor` or `as.factor`

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  mutate(cyl_fact = factor(cyl)) %>% 
  select(cyl_fact, cyl)
```

---
# As always, it is best to be explicit

If you do not specify the levels R will alphabetise and set the order accordingly

```{r}
months <- factor(c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar"))
```

--

```{r}
months
```

---

# Levels vs Labels, huh?

`levels` are the numeric representation of a factor

`labels` are the pretty name that it is given

--

### Practically

**Labels** are nice for printing

**Levels** are for ordering and doing math


---

# A Practical use case

#### Likert Scale

```{r}
likert_agree <- c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Neither Agree/ Nor Disagree", "Agree", "Strongly Agree")
```

--

#### We have some data

```{r}
response_group <- data_frame(response = c(1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,4 ,4, 2, 3, 4))
```

--

#### And we want to do some analysis

```{r}
mean(response_group$response)
```

---

# A Practical Use Case

.pull-left[
```{r}
response_group %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, 
                           likert_agree, 
                           levels = 1:5)) %>% 
  count(response)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE}
response_group %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, likert_agree, levels = 1:5)) -> response_group
```


```{r}
ggplot(response_group, aes(response)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE)
```

# So how do we fix the defaults?


---

# Enter the `forcats` package

- Tidyverse package<sup>1</sup>

- (almost ) All functions begin with the `fct_` prefix

- Designed to help make working with factors easier<sup>2</sup>

# A Practical Example

An Extract from the [General Social Survey](http://gss.norc.org/) is provided in `forcats`

```{r}
gss_cat
```

---

# Let's take a peak

```{r}
glimpse(gss_cat)
```


---

# Let's Examine the Religion Section A Little Closer

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  count(relig)
```


---

# Enter `forcats` for aggregation

.pull-left[
`fct_lump` will help us by grouping infrequent groups of our specifcation together

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  mutate(relig = fct_lump(relig, n = 4)) %>% 
  count(relig)
```
]

.pull-right[
`fct_other` will replace non-specified with others

```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  mutate(relig = fct_other(relig, 
                           keep = c("Christian", "Moslem/islam", "Jewish"))) %>% 
  count(relig)
```


]
---
# Some additional functions

`fct_collapse` can be used when you want to collapse a specific factor together

.pull-left[
```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  count(partyid)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
gss_cat %>% 
  mutate(party_id_rd = fct_collapse(partyid,
    Rep = c("Strong republican", "Not str republican"),
    Dem = c("Strong democrat", "Not str democrat"),
    Ind = c("Ind,near rep", "Independent", "Ind,near dem"))) %>% 
  count(party_id_rd)
```
]

---
# We can also recode the levels completely

`fct_recode` will allows us to recode based on our own wishes



.pull-left[
#### Syntax
```{r eval = FALSE}
data %>% 
  mutate( x = fct_recode(x,
                         "New name1" = "Old Name1",
                         "New name2" = "Old Name2")

```

]



.pull-left[
#### Example
```{r eval = TRUE}
gss_cat %>% 
  mutate( rincome = fct_recode(rincome,
                    "Too much to say" = "Refused",
                    "None" = "Not applicable")) %>% 
  select(rincome)

```

]

---

# Sometimes we want to change the ordering of factors

`fct_relevel` Reset the factor orders

`fct_inorder` Orders based on appearence in the data

`fct_infreq` Orders from most common to leave common

`fct_rev` Reverses the orders of the levels

---
# True Motivating Need

Modeling and analysis!!!

--

### Analysis of Variance for Example...

```{r}
aov(tvhours ~ rincome, data = gss_cat) %>% 
  summary()
```

---
# One Note

IF you create a factor and you specify a value that is not in the levels you will get an `NA` silently!

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Yes", "No", "Maybe")

factor(my_vector, c("Yes", "No"))
```

--
If you use `forcats` `parse_factor` you will be pased an NA

```{r error=TRUE}
parse_factor(my_vector, c("Yes", "No"))
```


---
# _Aside_ History of Factors

R developed as a statistical computing environment

Statisticians do experiements (often in blocks)

Factors make sense in this context

Additionally, it saved memory because factors could be represented with `numbers` rather than `characters`

# Recap

Factors are useful for

- Summarising Categorical Data

- Representing Categorical Data in Analysis

- Organising Graphs

- `forcats` provides a `tidyverse` approach to factors
